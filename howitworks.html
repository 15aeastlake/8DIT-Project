          Microcontrollers primarily work to take input and produce output to control something they're connected to.
          These inputs and outputs are a key feature of microcontrollers.
          It can be thought that the input of the microcontroller takes signals and information from something, whether it be a sensor or a switch.

          The microcontroller then uses this data to make a decision about what to do next.
          It does this using it's software components that would have been installed on it ahead of time.
          By running its input information through this, it is able to decide if and where it should send an output.
          This output can do many things, from turning on lights to activating another piece of hardware.
